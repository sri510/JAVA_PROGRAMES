/*
write a Java program to calculate compound interest for 3 year? 

 Formula-

Total amount=principle*((1+rate/100)*(1+rate/100)*(1+rate/100));

Compound intrest = amount â€“ principle;

Output:

Enter the principal amount (P): 25000

Enter the annual interest rate (R): 24

The compound interest after 3 years is: 22665.6
